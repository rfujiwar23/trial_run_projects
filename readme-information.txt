Creating trials for an app for jazz big band leaders (and members) so they can organize
the music (multiple charts - score and parts, along with audio file/link) to give to the band.

Trying to find the javaScript code (pdf.js?  scanner.js? or would it be Google API?) in which scans the pdf file
for the part name of the chart (ie: Alto Sax 1, Alto 2, Trumpet 1, Flugelhorn 2, etc)
and matches it with the corresponding musician.
1. And most  it is in a Jazz (InkPen) font or handwritten for old copies, would reading a handwritten or InkPen font and turning it into a string work?
2. Would the javaScript code or Google API be able to separate the pdf file (70-80 page) into single set of parts?
  a. Would it also be able to separate by the section? (saxophone, trumpet, trombone, rhythm section)
  b. If possible, detect for instrumental doubles, specifically to look for "to flute", "to clarinet", "soprano" for saxophone section

Create a method to check if the input string matches the already stored string (symbol), regardless of the string length
(ie: Alto 1 --> Alto Saxophone 1)
